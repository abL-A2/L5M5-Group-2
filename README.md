## Level 5 Mission 5 - Group 2 

Inside the Z-Energy folder is our Mission 05 - Phase 2 project.
This project was built using React, Node.js, Express, Google Maps API services, and MongoDB.
The page allows the user to enter an address, and it displays the three nearest Z stations, using data from the Maps API's, and then it displays information about fuel prices and station amenities, all taken from the database and displayed for the user.
